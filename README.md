#U+Game

Hello there,

so you want to be developer in U+? We prepared a little challenge for you. No bullshit, just a real world scenario, you could face as dev here.


## Description
We love to play our Playstation in office, one of the game here is GTA V. But we would like to buy older games from this series. And of course as cheap as possible.
You will be Backend developer providing API endpoint for your colleague on frond-end checking if game is cheap enough to buy.

Your tech stack will be Nest.js which is wrapper around Node.js + Express taking advantage of Typescript. If you don't know it, check it out, its really easy to start, check `https://docs.nestjs.com/`.

## Your task
You will work with API `https://www.cheapshark.com/api/`. Lucky for you somebody just started on this project, so continue, where he left
- Expand app logic to fetch the cheapest price ever for game (spoiler alert - you need to call `https://www.cheapshark.com/api/documentation.html#deals`)
- return just data in IGame interface to endpoint GET `/games`
## Installation and run

```bash
$ npm install
```
```bash
$ npm start
```
